# about the app
This app is made in order to help you find the basic information about the movieüéûÔ∏è you would like to watchüëÄ. It will provide you with short information about a movie and its trailer.

# additional information
To develop the app I decided to use a different API from the test task(TMDB API) because I believe it can provide me with more detailed information about the movie, and also the database of it is more extensive than the OMDB'S database. As an additional feature, I made a search bar with autocomplete, so users can see the variants of movies names!
